Python is a good choice for teaching image processing because:

1.It is freely available and open source. Since it is a free software, all students will have access to it without any restriction.

2.It provides pre-packed installations available for all major platforms at no cost.

3.It is the high-level language of choice for scientists and engineers.

4.It is recognized as perhaps the easiest language to learn for non-programmers.

Notes and work from EdX EPFL Image Processing and Analysis for Life Scientists

It is extremely important to know the properties, or, the transfer function of the imaging system. In every lens based system (we will exclusively use images from such system here) the image of an object is the convolution of the light emitted of the object and its surroundings, with the response function of the imaging system.

Mathematically, the image of the object is obtained by convoluting the object with the response function of the imaging system. In light microscopy, the response function is often called the point spread function. A response or point spread function is responsible for the resolution power of the imaging system.

This is why microscopy is often called diffraction limited.

### Questions
A bigger spot size or less resolution is expected when we decrease the NA of the imaging system, or use longer wavelength.
